## Welcome to Pickup, the ultimate platform for basketball enthusiasts who are looking for local pickup games in their city. Born out of passion for the sport and the need to connect with like-minded players, Pickup aims to bridge the gap between basketball courts and those itching for a game.

- Instant Access to Local Games: Browse and join ongoing games near you. Whether you're in your hometown or traveling, there's always a game waiting for you to join.
- Skill Matching: With our unique skill-matching feature, ensure you're playing with people of similar abilities. Whether you're a newbie or an experienced player, there's a spot for you.
- Create Your Game: Want to play on your terms? Set up your game, define the rules, choose the skill level, and watch players join.
- Private Games: Want a more exclusive session with your pals? Set up private games with a unique passcode. Only those with the passcode can view the game details and join.
- Community Building: Connect with players, make new friends, and build a community of basketball enthusiasts in your city.

## TechStack

For this project, we used Next.JS 13 for building our front-end. For our back-end, we used a combination of Python and Flask to connect to our front end, and used MySQL to store our data for each game.

## Challenges

All of us had zero to minimal experience using Next, JS, and working with databases so there was a lot of learning and understanding what to do before implementation which definitely pushed back our timeline. Another big challenge was planning, as we thought of implementing features like Maps API, private games locked with a passcode, joining other games, user login and auth, and skill-based matching. However, because we wanted to use this opportunity to work with and learn new technologies, we spent most of our time learning to use the technologies, minimizing our time to implement our vision.
