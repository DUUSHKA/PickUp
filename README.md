## TechStack

For this project, we used Next.JS 13 for creating our front end and pages. For back-end we used a combination of Python and Flask to connect to our front end, and used MySQL to store our data for each game.

## Challenges

All of us had 0 experience using Next, JS, and working with databases so there was a lot of learning and understanding what to do before implementation which definitely pushed back our timeline. Another big challenge was planning, as we thought of implementing features like Maps API, private games locked with a passcode, joining other games, user login and auth, and skill-based matching. However since setting up and working on the project took so long, we were unable to have these features in our hack.
